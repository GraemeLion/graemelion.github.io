<h1> How hard is it? </h1>

<p>Okay, so I'm going through my own little horror story with Comcast.  I'd like this to get boosted a bit.  Because I feel I've just been unable to get anything done at all.</p>

<p>On July 5, I purchased a Tivo Roamio.  And then I ran by the local comcast office to pick up a cablecard.  I received a dusty old looking card with a peeling label.   I also alledgely got my bill reduced as I could find packages that would do that.   I had to nearly read the serial number off the receipt.  Upon plugging it into the Tivo, I was greeted with an error and told to contact comcast. </p>

<p>I contacted comcast, and was told that this cablecard was literally pulled from a box, and thus was not and would not ever work in my Tivo.  I was told to return the card.   So we went back to the service center in Murfreesboro, TN.  (Located in Rutherford County.)  There are five service centers around me, and each of them are open for basically business hours only.   I was told upon returning there that we "must be doing something wrong", and to try it again.  Returned home, tried again.</p>

<p>The card gave the same error.  Did not work.  We went back to the service center.   (This is an hour drive for me.)  Stood in line.  40 people, one window open.  Were told "Oh, this is a broken card. It doesn't work for you." Asked for a new card, and was told "Oh, we don't have cards for rutherford county here."  Murfreesboro is Rutherford county's county SEAT.  There are no other service centers.   It's just that one.  In the whole county.  The nearest comcast service center from there is one hour away.    Went home, called Comcast corporate.  Bounced through the phone maze, and was told how sorry they were.  They would UPS us a cable card.   And credit us one week.</p>

<p>Three weeks pass, and we get nothing.  Call comcast corporate again.  This time, we're told they had no such record of any of our calls.  Or visits.  Or anything.  There definitely wasn't a bill credit, there may not have been that massive reduction I got when I visited comcast, and there certainly was no cablecard on the way.   Fought over the phone with people incapable of speaking english for nearly an hour.   Finally got confirmation.  A cablecard will be UPS'd to us.  </p>

<p>It arrived today.</p>

<p>It's a cable box.  A  set top box.  Not a cable card.  Nothing that we can use here (unless I want to give up the Tivo, which I don't think is an option I want at this point.  Also, they charged us $29 to expedite that shipping.)</p>

<p>I'm now past the return period for the Tivo, and have a $75 ETF with them if I cancel my year commitment.  I've now had no TV for a month, been lied to so many times it's not even funny, and do not know what else I can do.    This is disgusting behavior.  </p>

<p>Ideas?</p>

<P><B>EDIT:</B> Comcast has been in touch with me, and I'm waiting on hearing the resolution.  They want to talk.  This is their very, very last chance. I've already been contacted by other companies who want my internet and TV business</P>

<P><B>EDIT 2:</B> I knew I was expecting too much.  Radio silence again. </P>
